# AdvGAN Attack to YOLO
## Challenge - [SafeBench Perception Attack](https://safebench.github.io/)

Our solution is to apply [AdvGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02610) Model to generate adversarial examples of Stop Sign for Object Detection (YOLOv5) in three attack modes: 
- Targeted
- Untargeted (object label)
- Untargeted (object existence)
